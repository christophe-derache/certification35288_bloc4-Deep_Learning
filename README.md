## AT&T Spam Detector project
>*One of the main pain point that AT&T users are facing is constant exposure to SPAM messages. AT&T has been able to manually flag spam messages for a time, but they are looking for an automated way of detecting spams to protect their users. Your goal is to build a spam detector, that can automatically flag spams as they come based sollely on the sms' content.*
